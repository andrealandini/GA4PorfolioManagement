# Cover's Universal Portfolios & GAs

Universal Portfolios is a financial investment strategy that seeks to maximize the return on investment by continuously adapting to changing market conditions. It works by constructing a diversified portfolio of assets that are chosen based on their past performance and their expected future returns. The idea behind this strategy is that by combining multiple assets, the risk of the portfolio can be reduced while still maintaining high returns.

However, despite its potential benefits, constructing a universal portfolio is a challenging task. There are many factors to consider, such as the historical performance of each asset, the correlation between different assets, and the risk tolerance of the investor. Additionally, the market conditions can change rapidly, making it difficult to optimize the portfolio continuously.

One approach to address these challenges is to use a Genetic Algorithm. A Genetic Algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. It works by generating a population of potential solutions, evaluating their fitness based on a specific criterion, and then using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to create new generations of potential solutions. The idea is that over time, the algorithm will converge to a near-optimal solution that meets the desired criteria.

In the context of Universal Portfolios, a Genetic Algorithm can be used to optimize the portfolio allocation based on the historical performance of different assets. By using a fitness function that takes into account factors such as risk, return, and correlation between assets, the algorithm can identify the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk. This approach can lead to improved returns compared to traditional methods of portfolio optimization, making it an attractive strategy for investors seeking higher returns.
